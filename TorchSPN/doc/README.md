# SPN Library

This is a library that the Artificial Intelligence Group at the University of Waterloo are developing .

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. We will be adding a setup.py for easy installation soon.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Torch
Numpy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
pip3 install http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu80/torch-0.2.0.post3-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl 
pip3 install torchvision
pip3 install numpy
```

Alternatively, you can setup a virtualenv and activate it, and install the above into that.
